Task4:
The function must accept parameters and return a value. Determine how many even digits are in the entered number, and how many are odd.
If the number is divisible by 2 without remainder (i.e. the remainder is zero), then it is even.
Display the message: "Even: a Odd: b", where a is the number of even digits and b is the number of odd digits.

Example for the number 7877:
 Even: 1  Odd: 3
